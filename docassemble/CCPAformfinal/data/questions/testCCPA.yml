  **Welcome to the CCPA Assistance request form.**
    
  This form explains who and what is covered by the CCPA, describes how you can exercise your rights, and provides auto-generated text for you to make a formal request with.
  
  The CCPA gives California residents important rights regarding their personal information and allows them to request data-collecting businesses to handle their personal information in various ways.

  Why Should You Care?
content: |
  Today, it's a standard practice for businesses to use your personal information for many different purposes. A lot of information about you and your household can be collected with or without your knowledge, which can be used by individual businesses, shared with related companies, and made available to others. 
  
  Information that is gathered about you is combined and analyzed to create profiles of your preferences, behavior, attitudes, abilities and other characteristics. Exercising your rights to limit the data businesses can use, store, and share  can help protect you from unwanted, unfair, or harmful uses of your personal information.

question: |
  As a California resident, you have the right to:
subquestion: |
  - **Know** the types of personal information a business collects about you and how it's         used, as well as **see** the specific pieces of personal information a business has           collected about you.
  - **Delete** the personal information a business collected about you.
  - **Opt-out of the sale** of your personal information.
  
  Some of the rights the CCPA grants are automatic, while others require you to take steps to     exercise them.

template: ccpa_for_instance
subject: |
  For example
content: |
  California citizens automatically have the right not to be discriminated against by a business for exercising their CCPA rights. 
  
  In contrast, California residents must actively notify businesses when they want to know, delete, or opt-out of the sale of their personal information. The CCPA also allows California residents to sue a business if it fails to implement reasonable security measures when their personal information is compromised in a data breach.

template: ccpa_additional_info
subject: |
  Additional CCPA information that may be useful
content: |
  - You may make the request to each business **twice a year**, free of charge.
   
  - Some businesses provide a form on their website to submit these requests. If you have an account with a business, that business may require you to file your request through the account. However, if you do not have an account, a business cannot require you to create one in order to file a right to know request. Instead, you can contact a business directly (a sample letter is attached below).

  - **A business has 45 days to respond to your request**, although this may be extended for another 45 days for a total of 90 days.

  - A business is allowed to ask you for additional information to verify your request. However, they are not allowed to use that information for purposes other than verifying your request.

  - A business should respond with:
    
         (1) The categories of personal information it has collected about you, and
    
         (2) The specific pieces of information it has collected about you.
   
  - A business may respond with only the categories if it cannot verify your request, however it must tell you what additional information it needs in order to verify your request for the specific pieces of personal information.
